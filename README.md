This repository provides a simple framework for time series analysis, decomposition, and forecasting using Python.
It includes utilities for reading data, plotting time series, decomposing into trend/seasonality/residuals, and forecasting.

#Features

##Data Reading

*read_data() in reading_data.py

Reads CSV data, parses a datetime column, and sets it as index.

##Visualization

*plot_time_series_data() in ts_plots.py

Plots time series with well-formatted date axis (Year-Month, quarterly ticks).

##Decomposition

*seasonality_decopositioin() for classical decomposition

*stl_decopose() for robust decomposition using STL (LOESS)

#Forecasting Workflow

1.Perform STL decomposition â†’ separate trend, seasonality, and residuals.

2.Forecast trend and residuals using an ARIMA or another forecasting model.

3.Add back seasonality from the STL decomposition.

4.Get the final forecast = (forecasted (trend + residuals) + seasonality).
